# Basic JS-Playground

This app is built to demonstrate my ability to build some basic JavaScript objects.
Having worked as a Chef, I think it would be great to build an app that can
record some of your basic kitchen equipment.  We can have several methods
that help keep track of this. Below are the methods and what they will do.
add_Equipment('Name', Price) - adds an item to the kitchen equipment object
count_Equipment() - totals the number of items within the object
tot_Cost() - returns the total cost of all objects
to_String() - returns a string of all data with names, and price
remove_Equipment('Name') - remove the specified item
